## 2D Arrays First Assignment

Create an 2D array A[5][5] and generate numbers into the array from interval <-20,120>
- Calculate the average of a row number(that you input)
- Calculate the average of a column number(that you input)
- Find the highest number from the principal diagonal

## 2D Arrays Second Assignment

- Create a 2D Array named students[3][6] with three rows as Student's ID and six columns as their grades 
- We have n number of students, every student has m marks/grades
- Calculate arithmetic average of every student
- Calculate their ratings<br>
- Ratings:<br> (PV-average <=1.5 worst grade can be 2)<br>
         (PVD-average <=2.0 worst grade can be 3)<br>
         (P- worst grade can be 4)<br>
         (N- if student has at least one bad mark like 5)
